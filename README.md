The goal of `CALIBERate` is to provide a set of tools for working with Electronic Health Record (EHR) data
using phenotypes in the CALIBER format.  
  
It is built for the purpose of helping me transform tables of ICD-10 codes from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) 
Admitted Patient Care (APC) into the validated CALIBER phenotypes described in the following paper:  
  
> Kuan et al., ‘A Chronological Map of 308 Physical and Mental Health Conditions from 4 Million Individuals in the English National Health Service’.
[DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30012-3](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30012-3)  
  
The authors have kindly made these [phenotypes available on GitHub](https://github.com/spiros/chronological-map-phenotypes) and this is incorporated 
into this package using `https://github.com/spiros/chronological-map-phenotypes`.  
  
  
**Please note this is independent work and not associated with/endorsed by the CALIBER team**

## Installation

You can install the latest version from
[github](https://github.com/tomlincr/CALIBERate) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("tomlincr/CALIBERate")
```

## Functions

Further documentation can be viewed by browsing the `.Rd` files within `./man/` and via, hopefully understandable, comments within the code.  

I will endeavour to update this documentation in due course, pending coursework pressures/deadlines!
